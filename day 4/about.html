    <h1>About :</h1>
    <p align="left">My name is Rajunala Riteesh, and I have recently completed my B.Tech in Electronics and Telecommunication from New Horizon College of Engineering, Bengaluru. I am passionate about data analytics and have built a strong foundation in tools such as Power BI, Tableau, Advanced Excel, MySQL and Python.

During my Data Analytics internship, I worked on an Insurance Data Analysis & Dashboarding project, where I handled raw data extraction, cleaning, transformation, and dashboard creation. I built interactive dashboards using Power BI and Tableau to track KPIs like claim status, fraud detection, and customer retention, which helped stakeholders make better decisions.  ￼

I have also completed academic projects like HR Analytics and Crowdfunding Analysis, where I analyzed employee retention and campaign success patterns using SQL, Excel, and BI tools, and presented insights through dashboards and reports.  

My key strengths include analytical thinking, attention to detail, and good communication skills. I enjoy exploring data to find patterns and using visualization to tell meaningful business stories.

I am now looking for an opportunity as a Data Analyst, where I can apply my skills, learn from experienced professionals, and contribute to data-driven decision-making.<br>

--Thank you--</p>
